    "#### What is Routing in LangGraph?\n",
    "Routing in LangGraph refers to the ability to conditionally determine which node to execute next based on the current state or the output of a node. This is typically implemented using:\n",
    "\n",
    "- add_conditional_edges: A method that maps a node’s output (or a condition function’s result) to different possible next nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- State: The workflow’s state can store variables that influence routing decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Condition Functions: Functions that evaluate the state or node output to decide the next step.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Concepts\n",
    "- Dynamic Flow: Unlike a linear sequence, routing lets the graph adapt to intermediate results.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Condition Logic: You define rules (e.g., \"if this, go here; if that, go there\").\n",
    "\n",
    "- Flexibility: Combines well with parallelization or sequential chains for complex workflows.\n"

      "Wait, maybe a classic setup where the AI does something unexpected because of its autonomy. Like, \"Why did the Agentic AI system refuse to play hide and seek?\" Then the punchline could be that it hid so well it became a \"black box,\" which is a term used to describe systems whose inner workings are opaque. That's a pun on \"black box\" which has a double meaning here—both hiding and the technical term.\n",

      "In the heart of a sunlit courtyard, where the air hummed with the scent of jasmine and the distant call of peacocks, a young girl named Aarushi tied the sacred thread around her wrist. At twelve years old, she had chosen her calling: to become a *bharatanrityam* dancer, a medium through which centuries of stories would flow through her body. \n",
      "\n",
      "Every morning, under the watchful gaze of her guru, Madhavi Amma, Aarushi’s world became a tapestry of *mudras* (hand gestures), *adavus* (basic steps), and the whisper of bells tied to her ankles. The dance was both discipline and devotion. “Each movement is a prayer,” Madhavi Amma would say, her voice like the rustle of palm leaves. “The earth is your stage, the cosmos your audience.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Aarushi practiced relentlessly. Her fingers learned the alphabet of *mudras*: the “saluting hand” to honor the divine, the “peacock’s beak” to mimic nature’s grace, and the “thunderbolt” to evoke power. Her body memorized the geometry of the *mandala*, the dance’s sacred circle, where every step had to be precise, yet alive. Yet, the true challenge came with the *abhinaya*—the storytelling, where her face and eyes had to convey joy, sorrow, and wonder without a single word.\n",
      "\n",
      "One monsoon evening, as rain lashed the courtyard, Aarushi stumbled into doubt. A misstep during a recital had drawn a murmur through the audience, and her confidence wavered. “What if I dishonor the dance?” she whispered to Madhavi Amma, tears blurring the diya’s flame. “The dance is not about perfection,” her teacher replied, her eyes soft but unyielding. “It’s about *bhava*—the emotion that transcends the body.”\n",
      "\n",
      "That night, memories stirred. Aarushi thought of her grandmother, a dancer who had once told her tales of temple dancers called *devadasis*, whose art once flourished in grand temples, weaving myth and devotion into movement. She imagined the story of Lord Shiva’s *Tandava*, his cosmic dance of creation and destruction, and the delicate *Lasya* of Sati, his consort. These were the stories in her veins. \n",
      "\n",
      "Determined, Aarushi returned to practice, her movements now slower, more deliberate. She danced the sorrow of Krishna’s separation from Radha, her eyes welling with unshed tears; she became the warrior Arjuna, his resolve etched in her posture. Slowly, the dance ceased to be about flawlessness and became a conversation with the divine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Years passed. On the eve of her debut performance at the Chidambaram Temple, where the air buzzed with the scent of incense, Aarushi stood backstage, her body adorned in a crimson silk *saree* studded with gold thread. The *mridangam* drums began, and as she stepped onto the stage, the lights dimmed, leaving only the glow of oil lamps. \n",
      "\n",
      "The dance began—a dialogue between earth and sky. Her feet stamped in *jathis*, rapid and precise, while her hands unfurled tales of the Ramayana. In the *vira rasa* (valor), she was Sita’s defiance; in *shringara* (love), the longing of gopis for Krishna. When she reached the *Tillana*, the climax, her body moved like a river—fluid, unstoppable. The audience was breathless.\n",
      "\n",
      "In that moment, Aarushi felt the presence of her grandmother, her guru, and the countless dancers who’d come before her. Their whispers became the rhythm of her breath, their joy and struggles fused into her every step. Time dissolved. She was no longer merely Aarushi but the embodiment of a tradition that had spanned millennia, a living link between the ancient and the eternal.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the final note faded, the crowd erupted. But for Aarushi, the triumph was quieter: she had touched the timelessness within the art. Classical dance, she realized, was not just movement—it was a language of the soul, a bridge between the ephemeral and the eternal. And so, the rhythm continued, as it had for thousands of years, whispering through every dancer who dared to listen.\n",
      "\n",
      "---  \n",
      "**Epilogue:**  \n",
      "Years later, Aarushi would tell her own students: “Dance is not a performance. It is a conversation with the universe. When you move, you carry the stories of those who came before you. And when you stop, the stories will carry you.”  \n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, the dance lived on—a silent, swirling dialogue between past and present, a testament to the timeless heartbeat of art.\n"
