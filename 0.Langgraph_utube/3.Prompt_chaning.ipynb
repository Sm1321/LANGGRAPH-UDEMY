These changes can manifest in the form of new words and expressions entering the language, old words falling out of use, shifts in grammar rules, and changes in language usage and pronunciation. In today's digital age, the language graph is evolving rapidly due to the widespread use of social media, the internet, and other communication technologies. As a result, languages are constantly adapting and evolving to meet the needs and preferences of their speakers. It is important for linguists, educators, and language enthusiasts to stay informed about these changes in order to better understand and appreciate the dynamic nature of language.\", additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 142, 'prompt_tokens': 15, 'total_tokens': 157, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-3.5-turbo-0125', 'system_fingerprint': None, 'id': 'chatcmpl-BsNtSGJOpknfZXxvolJZIjAlcIp6d', 'service_tier': 'default', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run--6d7b6bb7-ab16-4c2d-8ede-9c6f13d00b6f-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 15, 'output_tokens': 142, 'total_tokens': 157, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}})"
